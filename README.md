# Space Challenge

<i> Space-Challenge project for <a href = "https://in.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-programming-in-java--ud283" title = "Udacity's OOPS in Java"> Udacity's Object Oriented Programming in Java </a> course </i> 

This is the capstone project of Udacity's <i> Object Oriented Programming in Java </i> course.

Project Summary
---------------
The goal of the project was to run simulations of two types of rockets and determine the correct type to use for the mission to Mars. The specs for both rockets can be found <a href = "github.com/kkrcodes/SpaceChallenge/blob/master/specs/Rocket_Specs.txt"> here </a>. The mission consists of two phases, therefore there are two lists of items to be carried in the rockets. They can be found <a href = "https://github.com/kkrcodes/SpaceChallenge/tree/master/specs"> here </a>. The project runs simulations of loading these items into the rockets, launching and landing them in both phases. It calculates the total budget required for each type of rocket (including crashes) to reach Mars successfully and
displays them, allowing to choose the cheaper (and correct) type of rocket.
